<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We are going to simulate the MESI protocol with a variable number of cores in a processor, as well as transactional memory using the lazy optimistic scheme. We will then use our simulation to measure bus traffic and contention, as well as transactional memory commits and aborts.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>There are several different implementations of cache coherence protocols, some of the foremost protocols are the MSI, MESI, and Dragon protocols. We will implement the MESI protocol, which is similar to the MSI, except for the added exclusive state which adds the benefit of decreased bus traffic. We will add a layer of transactional memory on top of the MESI implementation.
We will use the lazy versioning scheme of transactional memory, which logs memory updates into a transaction write buffer. The buffer is then flushed to memory upon a commit. In order to detect conflicts between multiple processors we will use optimistic detection. Optimistic conflict detection only checks for conflicts when a transaction attempts to commit. When a conflict occurs, the committing transaction gets priority, while the other transaction must abort and restart later.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>

<p>We will need to simulate a variable core processor, where each core contains an L1 cache. For each core, we need to keep track of the cache hits, cache misses, the number of times this core has contended for the bus, and the number of times this core has won the bus. We will also have to learn how to use Contech in order to generate memory traces to test our simulations with. Lastly we will implement a simulation of transactional memory, which will provide the added benefit of synchronization between caches.</p>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>We will be using the information presented in lecture slides to implement the MESI protocol and transactional memory. We will use the Contech to generate memory traces of parallel programs to analyze and simulate the cache interactions on our processor.</p>

<h3>
<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

<p>By the end of the project, we should have analysis on cache snooping using the MESI protocol on varying memory traces, as well as how the bus traffic changes as the number of cores increases. We will also have a simulation of transactional memory to create synchronization between processors and avoid race conditions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>

<p>Seeing as we are simulating the processor, the machine we run on doesnâ€™t need any special hardware. We will use C++ to write our simulator and cache coherence implementation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h3>

<p>April 4 - 10 : Implement a single-core processor that reads in Contech memory traces
April 11 - 17 : Implement MESI cache coherence protocol on a multi-core processor
April 18 - 24 : Add transactional memory to the multi-core processor
April 25 - May 1: Measure bus traffic and contention, and TM commits and aborts
May 2 - May 9: Analyze measurements and create presentations</p>
